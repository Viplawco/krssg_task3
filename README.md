Main changes are done in strategy.cc and rest all files are same. And yes the opponents file player numbers needs to be changed to 4 and
our own to 1 and we simply use functions from naobehaviors.cc.And kickBall(KICK_DRIBBLE, VecPosition(HALF_FIELD_X, -temp.getY(), 0));
is the best function ever which makes life so easy for our humainoid bot.
